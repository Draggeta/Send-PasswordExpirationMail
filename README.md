#Sysadmin Scripts

This repository contains various scripts I use to make my life easier. While there may be better scripts created by other people, I develop these to further my skills.

Right now it contains the following scripts and modules:

| Module/Script | Type | Status | Description | 
|:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| O365-RestV1 | Module | Finished | Module to use the O365 REST API. Right now only adds calendar items |
| O365-Tools | Module | Finished | Module to connect to Microsoft cloud services a bit easier |
| Send-PasswordExpirationMail | Script | In Development | Currently functions. Trying to rewrite it to make it better | 
| Set-O365License | Script | Finished | Module to set up Office 365 Licenses. Works with a JSON configuration file and a simple HTML e-mail template |
